# Lab 11 -  Flashcards

_Learning Objective: Demonstrate understanding of dictionaries_

This week we will be working on dictionaries, file input and string operations. If you have taken previous classes, you might recognize dictionaries as hash maps/tables. For everyone who hasn't seen them, they are basically look up tables, like our tradtional dictionaries.

You will be given a textfile called **"database.txt"** which has comma-separated values. This file has a key-value pair for flashcards. The first value is the question/term and the second item is the answer/defintion. 
You will use this file for input in your program to read in all the answers and questions and fill a dictionary with all these pairs.

After making the dictionary, you will iterate through all the "flashcards" by printing the question and then having the user hit "Enter" to see the answer. You should iterate through all the terms.

Finally, you will allow the user to enter any question and provide them with the answer. You will use the look-up function of dictionaries for this.


## Step 1: Create a dictionary

Create a fucntion called `build_dict(file_name)`. It takes a file_name string as parameter, and it returns a dictionary object whith the file content.

1) Opens up the file and iterates through each line
2) For EACH line:
   a) Separates the answer/question for each line based on a comma(",")
   b) Stores each answer and question appropriate in the dictionary
3) Returns the dictionary

## Step 2: Check the dictionary 

Create a function called `check_dict(key,dictionary)`. It takes in a string text to look up in the dictionary, 
and it returns the answer if found, or  "No match found" otherwise.

```
  IF term is in dictionary 
       Return answer
   ELSE
       Return "No match Found"
```

## Step 3: Create main

Create `main()` function
1) Build the dictionary by calling `build_dict(fileName)`
2) Iterate through dictionary(HINT: For Each loop)
   FOR EACH Key,Value Pair:
     print question
     prompt user to hit "Enter"
     print answer
3) WHILE User does not enter stop:
     Prompt user for a question/term to look up
     Call `check_dict(userInput)` and output return value
